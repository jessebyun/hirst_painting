<h2>Hirst Painting</h2>

Damien Hirst's "Spot Paintings" are a well-known series of meticulously detailed artworks. Grids of uniformly sized and spaced colorful spots appear in these artworks, which are frequently set on a white background. These works demonstrate Hirst's investigation of color, order, and unpredictability, and they defy traditional notions of artistic creativity. The size and color arrangement of the "Spot Paintings" vary, with some including hundreds or even thousands of spots, each painted with sharp edges and solid, brilliant colors. This series is a significant and influential section of Hirst's modern art portfolio, noted for its minimalist and conceptual approach that examines the artist's function and the essence of originality in art.

In this project, I am going to use the Turtle module to replicate my own version of Hirst's spot painting. First I used the colorgram module to extract the color palette from Hirst's spot painting and appended it into a color list. I then drew spots 10 x 10 with the turtle and randomly chose colors from the palette list. With this project I searched through the turtle module documentation to find the different functions to replicate this painting.
